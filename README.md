# project-scripts

**Create a new project**

`npm install -g jsonnull-create-project`

Then run `create-project path/to/my-app` to create a new project complete with starting configuration.

**Shared project scripts**

`npm install --save-dev jsonnull-project-scripts`

Common npm scripts, base configuration files, and more files which I share across projects can be referenced as a dependency.

The most common requirements are automatically linked in during project creation with the CLI tool.
